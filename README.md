Note:

- Boostrap 5 styles and scripts are loaded externally
- Dependencies needs to be installed
- Gulp needs to be set up


Gulp Steps:

1) Run 'npm install'

2) Update the proxy in gulpfile

3) Run 'gulp dev': Success?

Possible issues:

'npm install' fails

- Note this might be b/c of mismatch of node and gulp version. In order to fix, downgrade node to v14.
